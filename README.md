# interactive-algorithms
Inspired by 6.006, a collection of algorithms and datatypes (that I may later develop to be interactive, but for now are just *hopefully* well-commented)

##Algorithms
The collection of algorithms I have written
* [Rabin Karp](algorithms/rabinkarp.py) ~ Rabin-Karp substring searching algorithm
* [Rabin Karp Multi](algorithms/rabinkarpmulti.py) ~ Rabin-Karp substring searching algorithm for a list of patterns

##ADTs
The collection of abstract datatypes (ADTs) I have written
* [Rolling Hash](adts/rollinghash.py) ~ Rolling Hash datatype
